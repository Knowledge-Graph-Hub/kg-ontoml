# Experiments on Monarch Ontologies

The ontologies contributing to the Monarch Initiative resource 
are described within `monarch.owl`, available at:

```
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/upheno/monarch.owl
```

The variety of imported ontologies, when merged and treated
as a graph, is ideal for link prediction.
We may remove one or more ontologies prior to the link
prediction operation to determine their impact
on task results.
